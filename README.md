[The purpose of the repository is to show the evolution in the Java programming language through challenges in Beecrowd. Beecrowd is a platform for professionals and students who want to develop their programming skills. With that I tried to find the best way to program and move from basic to advanced knowledge. I can tell you that with the use of some tools I was able to evaluate my mistakes and I hope that this helps you as it helped me to become an advanced professional in the java programming area.]
